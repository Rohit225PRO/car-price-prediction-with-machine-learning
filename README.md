### 📈 Project Overview

This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning. It is made as part of the **AICTE Oasis Infobyte Internship**, providing hands-on experience with real-world data analysis and machine learning workflows.

The price of a car depends on several factors including:

* **Brand reputation**
* **Horsepower**
* **Mileage**
* **Features**
* And more!

Accurate car price prediction helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions and is a popular machine learning challenge.
